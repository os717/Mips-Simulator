# MIPS-1 Simulator

The simulator was made in c++

The testbench was made in bash

Use 'make simulator' to make the simulator

Use 'make testbench' to make the testbench

We have used a MIPS parser which we did not make and can be found here: https://github.com/olly-larkin/mips-parser/tree/8140e2ee94828e6510c30117ab9811600ed41862
